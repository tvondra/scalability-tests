    Optimize escaping of JSON strings
    
    There were quite a few places where we either had a non-NUL-terminated
    string or a text Datum which we needed to call escape_json() on.  Many of
    these places required that a temporary string was created due to the fact
    that escape_json() needs a NUL-terminated cstring.  For text types, those
    first had to be converted to cstring before calling escape_json() on them.
    
    Here we introduce two new functions to make escaping JSON more optimal:
    
    escape_json_text() can be given a text Datum to append onto the given
    buffer.  This is more optimal as it foregoes the need to convert the text
    Datum into a cstring.  A temporary allocation is only required if the text
    Datum needs to be detoasted.
    
    escape_json_with_len() can be used when the length of the cstring is
    already known or the given string isn't NUL-terminated.  Having this
    allows various places which were creating a temporary NUL-terminated
    string to just call escape_json_with_len() without any temporary memory
    allocations.

    Support falling back to non-preferred readline implementation with meson
    
    To build with -Dreadline=enabled one can use either readline or
    libedit. The -Dlibedit_preferred flag is supposed to control the order
    of names to lookup.  This works fine when either both libraries are
    present or -Dreadline is set to auto. However, explicitly enabling
    readline with only libedit present, but not setting libedit_preferred,
    or alternatively enabling readline with only readline present, but
    setting libedit_preferred, too, are both broken. This is because
    cc.find_library will throw an error for a not found dependency as soon
    as the first required dependency is checked, thus it's impossible to
    fallback to the alternative.
    
    Here we only check the second of the two dependencies for
    requiredness, thus we only fail when none of the two can be found.

    Support absolute bindir/libdir in regression tests with meson
    
    Passing an absolute bindir/libdir will install the binaries and
    libraries to <build>/tmp_install/<bindir> and
    <build>/tmp_install/<libdir> respectively.
    
    This path is correctly passed to the regression test suite via
    configure/make, but not via meson, yet. This is because the "/"
    operator in the following expression throws away the whole left side
    when the right side is an absolute path:
    
        test_install_location / get_option('libdir')
    
    This was already correctly handled for dir_prefix, which is likely
    absolute as well. This patch handles both bindir and libdir in the
    same way - prefixing absolute paths with the tmp_install path
    correctly.

    Introduce num_os_semaphores GUC.
    
    The documentation for System V IPC parameters provides complicated
    formulas to determine the appropriate values for SEMMNI and SEMMNS.
    Furthermore, these formulas have often been wrong because folks
    forget to update them (e.g., when adding a new auxiliary process).
    
    This commit introduces a new runtime-computed GUC named
    num_os_semaphores that reports the number of semaphores needed for
    the configured number of allowed connections, worker processes,
    etc.  This new GUC allows us to simplify the formulas in the
    documentation, and it should help prevent future inaccuracies.
    Like the other runtime-computed GUCs, users can view it with
    "postgres -C" before starting the server, which is useful for
    preconfiguring the necessary operating system resources.

    Wait for WAL summarization to catch up before creating .partial file.
    
    When a standby is promoted, CleanupAfterArchiveRecovery() may decide
    to rename the final WAL file from the old timeline by adding ".partial"
    to the name. If WAL summarization is enabled and this file is renamed
    before its partial contents are summarized, WAL summarization breaks:
    the summarizer gets stuck at that point in the WAL stream and just
    errors out.
    
    To fix that, first make the startup process wait for WAL summarization
    to catch up before renaming the file. Generally, this should be quick,
    and if it's not, the user can shut off summarize_wal and try again.
    To make this fix work, also teach the WAL summarizer that after a
    promotion has occurred, no more WAL can appear on the previous
    timeline: previously, the WAL summarizer wouldn't switch to the new
    timeline until we actually started writing WAL there, but that meant
    that when the startup process was waiting for the WAL summarizer, it
    was waiting for an action that the summarizer wasn't yet prepared to
    take.
    
    In the process of fixing these bugs, I realized that the logic to wait
    for WAL summarization to catch up was spread out in a way that made
    it difficult to reuse properly, so this code refactors things to make
    it easier.
    
    Finally, add a test case that would have caught this bug and the
    previously-fixed bug that WAL summarization sometimes needs to back up
    when the timeline changes.

    postgres_fdw: Fix bug in connection status check.
    
    The buildfarm member "hake" reported a failure in the regression test
    added by commit 857df3cef7, where postgres_fdw_get_connections(true)
    returned unexpected results.
    
    The function postgres_fdw_get_connections(true) checks
    if a connection is closed by using POLLRDHUP in the requested events
    and calling poll(). Previously, the function only considered
    POLLRDHUP or 0 as valid returned events. However, poll() can also
    return POLLHUP, POLLERR, and/or POLLNVAL. So if any of these events
    were returned, postgres_fdw_get_connections(true) would report
    incorrect results. postgres_fdw_get_connections(true) failed to
    account for these return events.
    
    This commit updates postgres_fdw_get_connections(true) to correctly
    report a closed connection when poll() returns not only POLLRDHUP
    but also POLLHUP, POLLERR, or POLLNVAL.

    pg_upgrade: Move live_check variable to user_opts.
    
    At the moment, pg_upgrade stores whether it is doing a "live check"
    (i.e., the user specified --check and the old server is still
    running) in a local variable scoped to main().  This live_check
    variable is passed to several functions.  To further complicate
    matters, a few call sites provide a hard-coded "false" as the
    live_check argument.  Specifically, this is done when calling these
    functions for the new cluster, for which any live-check-only paths
    won't apply.
    
    This commit moves the live_check variable to the global user_opts
    variable, which stores information about the options the user
    specified on the command line.  This allows us to remove the
    live_check parameter from several functions.  For the functions
    with callers that provide a hard-coded "false" as the live_check
    argument (e.g., get_control_data()), we verify the given cluster is
    the old cluster before taking any live-check-only paths.
    
    This small refactoring effort helps simplify some proposed changes
    that would parallelize many of pg_upgrade's once-in-each-database
    tasks using libpq's asynchronous APIs.  By removing the live_check
    parameter, we can more easily convert the functions to callbacks
    for the new parallel system.

    Allow WAL summarization to back up when timeline changes.
    
    The old code believed that it was not possible to switch timelines
    without first replaying all of the WAL from the old timeline, but
    that turns out to be false, as demonstrated by an example from Fujii
    Masao. As a result, it assumed that summarization would always
    continue from the LSN where summarization previously ended. But in
    fact, when a timeline switch occurs without replaying all the WAL
    from the previous timeline, we can need to back up to an earlier
    LSN. Adjust accordingly.

    This change allows these functions to be called using named-argument
    notation, which can be helpful for readability, particularly for

    There was considerable debate about exactly which names to use,

    Add path column to pg_backend_memory_contexts view
    
    "path" provides a reliable method of determining the parent/child
    relationships between memory contexts.  Previously this could be done in
    a non-reliable way by writing a recursive query and joining the "parent"
    and "name" columns.  This wasn't reliable as the names were not unique,
    which could result in joining to the wrong parent.
    
    To make this reliable, "path" stores an array of numerical identifiers
    starting with the identifier for TopLevelMemoryContext.  It contains an
    element for each intermediate parent between that and the current context.
    
    Incompatibility: Here we also adjust the "level" column to make it
    1-based rather than 0-based.  A 1-based level provides a convenient way
    to access elements in the "path" array. e.g. path[level] gives the
    identifier for the current context.
    
    Identifiers are not stable across multiple evaluations of the view.  In
    an attempt to make these more stable for ad-hoc queries, the identifiers
    are assigned breadth-first.  Contexts closer to TopLevelMemoryContext
    are less likely to change between queries and during queries.

    ci: Pin MacPorts version to 2.9.3.
    
    Commit d01ce180 invented a new way to find the latest MacPorts version.
    By bad luck, a new beta release has just been published, and it seems
    to lack some packages we need.  Go back to searching for this specific
    version for now.  We still search with a pattern so that we can find the
    package for the running version of macOS, but for now we always look for
    2.9.3.  The code to do that had been anticipated already in a commented
    out line, I just didn't expect to have to use it so soon...
    
    Also include the whole MacPorts installation script in the cache key, so
    that changes to the script cause a fresh installation.  This should make
    it a bit easier to reason about the effect of changes on cached state in
    github accounts using CI, when we make adjustments.
    
    Back-patch to 15, like d01ce180.

    ci: Upgrade macOS version from 13 to 14.
    
    1.  Previously we were using ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-XXX-base:latest
    images, but Cirrus has started ignoring that and using a particular
    image, currently ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-runner:sonoma, for github
    accounts using free CI resources (as opposed to dedicated runner
    machines, as cfbot uses).  Let's just ask for that image anyway, to stay
    in sync.
    
    2.  Instead of hard-coding a MacPorts installation URL, deduce it from
    the running macOS version and the available releases.  This removes the
    need to keep the ci_macports_packages.sh in sync with .cirrus.task.yml,
    and to advance the MacPorts version from time to time.
    
    3.  Change the cache key we use to cache the whole macports installation
    across builds to include the OS major version, to trigger a fresh
    installation when appropriate.

    pg_upgrade: Retrieve subscription count more efficiently.
    
    Presently, pg_upgrade obtains the number of subscriptions in the
    to-be-upgraded cluster by first querying pg_subscription in every
    database for the number of subscriptions in only that database.
    Then, in count_old_cluster_subscriptions(), it adds all the values
    collected in the first step.  This is expensive, especially when
    there are many databases.
    
    Fortunately, there is a better way to retrieve the subscription
    count.  Since pg_subscription is a shared catalog, we only need to
    connect to a single database and query it once.  This commit
    modifies pg_upgrade to use that approach, which also allows us to
    trim several lines of code.  In passing, move the call to
    get_db_subscription_count(), which has been renamed to
    get_subscription_count(), from get_db_rel_and_slot_infos() to the
    dedicated >= v17 section in check_and_dump_old_cluster().
    
    We may be able to make similar improvements to
    get_old_cluster_logical_slot_infos(), but that is left as a future
    exercise.

    Allow altering of two_phase option of a SUBSCRIPTION.
    
    The two_phase option is controlled by both the publisher (as a slot
    option) and the subscriber (as a subscription option), so the slot option
    must also be modified.
    
    Changing the 'two_phase' option for a subscription from 'true' to 'false'
    is permitted only when there are no pending prepared transactions
    corresponding to that subscription. Otherwise, the changes of already
    prepared transactions can be replicated again along with their corresponding
    commit leading to duplicate data or errors.
    
    To avoid data loss, the 'two_phase' option for a subscription can only be
    changed from 'false' to 'true' once the initial data synchronization is
    completed. Therefore this is performed later by the logical replication worker.

            INSERT INTO t (i[-2147483648:2147483647]) VALUES ('{}');
    
    To fix, perform the hazardous computations using overflow-detecting
    arithmetic routines.  As with commit 18b585155a, the added test
    cases generate errors that include a platform-dependent value, so
    we again use psql's VERBOSITY parameter to suppress printing the
    message text.

    Move extern declarations for EXEC_BACKEND to header files
    
    This fixes warnings from -Wmissing-variable-declarations (not yet part
    of the standard warning options) under EXEC_BACKEND.  The
    NON_EXEC_STATIC variables need a suitable declaration in a header file
    under EXEC_BACKEND.
    
    Also fix the inconsistent application of the volatile qualifier for
    PMSignalState, which was revealed by this change.

commit 3937cadfd4383fd32f3fd8d8dc5efc32b3d12664

    Use more consistently int64 for page numbers in SLRU-related code
    
    clog.c, async.c and predicate.c included some SLRU page numbers still
    handled as 4-byte integers, while int64 should be used for this purpose.
    
    These holes have been introduced in 4ed8f0913bfd, that has introduced
    the use of 8-byte integers for SLRU page numbers, still forgot about the
    code paths updated by this commit.
